# User Test Results: Local Business Owner Lukas

**Persona:** Lukas (45), Salon Owner. Impatient, low tech skills, wants results (customers).

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page
*Lukas opens the link on his laptop in the back office.*
"Okay, 'Houston'. AI Marketing. I've heard about this AI stuff. My nephew says I need it."
*He scrolls quickly, scanning headlines.*
"'Marketing that gets done'. Good. I don't want to learn marketing, I just want it done."
*He stops at pricing.*
"Free start. Then 10 Euros or 40 Euros. 10 is fine. Less than a haircut. 'No credit card' - perfect, I hate searching for my wallet."
*He looks for a phone number or 'Call us'.*
"No phone number. Classic tech company. Okay, I have to click 'Start Free'."

### 2. Onboarding
*Wizard starts.*
"Industry: 'Hair Salon'. Company Size: '6'. Target Audience: 'People in Munich, neighborhood Lehel'. Goals: 'Full booking book'."
*He types short, fragmented sentences.*
*Step 3: Summary.*
"The AI writes: 'Lokaler Friseursalon in München-Lehel, Fokus auf Neukundengewinnung und Auslastung'. Yeah, that's right. Fast."
*Step 4: SMART Goals.*
"Goals... 'Increase monthly bookings by 15%'. 'Generate 20 Google Reviews'.
Okay, the Google Reviews one is good. I can do that. The 15% bookings... how does it measure that? It doesn't have access to my booking system (Phorest). This goal seems a bit theoretical."
*He frowns.*
"I'll click 'Weiter', but I'm skeptical how it tracks my offline customers."

### 3. Dashboard & First Interaction
*Dashboard loads.*
"There's a lot going on here. 'Credits', 'Insights', 'Playbooks'. What is a Playbook? Is that like a manual?"
*He sees the 'Today's Focus' card.*
"It says 'Lass uns loslegen'. Okay. I click 'Erstes Gespräch starten'."
*Chat.*
"I type: 'I have an empty slot tomorrow at 14:00. How do I fill it?'"
*He waits.*
"Houston says: 'Post a Story on Instagram with a "Last Minute Deal" - 20% off for tomorrow 14:00. Here is a text draft: ...'"
"Okay, THAT is useful. I can copy-paste that. I don't have to think of a text."
*He looks for where to paste it.*
"Wait, can Houston post it for me? No? I have to do it myself. Okay, fair enough, but 'Marketing that gets done' made me hope it would actually DO it."

### 4. Conclusion
"It's good for text ideas. I like the quick answers. But the dashboard looks a bit like a spaceship cockpit – too many buttons I don't understand yet. 'Strategy Analysis' sounds like homework. I just want the 'Fill my calendar' button."

## B) Observed Issues & Delights

### Issues
*   **Integration Gap:** Lukas realized the SMART goal "Increase bookings" can't be automatically tracked because Houston isn't connected to his salon software. This breaks the promise of "tracking progress".
*   **Terminology:** "Playbooks" is a jargon term he didn't understand immediately. "Manual" or "Recipe" might be better for him.
*   **Expectation vs Reality:** He hoped "Marketing that gets done" meant *automation* (posting for him), not just *generating text*.

### Delights
*   **Speed:** The specific answer to his "empty slot" problem was instant and high quality.
*   **Price:** The clear "No credit card" and low entry price removed his barrier to entry.

## C) Ratings
*   **Understanding:** 7/10
*   **Ease of Onboarding:** 9/10 (Short inputs worked well).
*   **Confidence:** 6/10 (Skeptical about tracking offline results).
*   **Likelihood to Return:** 7/10 (Mainly for writing captions).

## Round 2 Validation (Phase 1 & 2)

**Date:** 03.12.2025
**Focus:** Dashboard Clarity, Playbooks, Manual Tracking

### Scenario Re-run
*Lukas lands on the Dashboard.*
"Okay, 'Deine Ziele sind bereit! 🎯'.
The 'Playbooks (Anleitungen)' link is clear.
Now I see my goal: 'Generate 20 Google Reviews'.
And there is a button: 'Check-in'. I click it."

*Check-in Modal Opens.*
" 'Hast du Fortschritte gemacht?'. Yes, actually. I got 3 reviews this week.
I drag the slider. 5% -> 15%.
I type a note: 'Mrs. Müller left a review'.
Click 'Speichern'.
Confetti! 'Fortschritt gespeichert'.
The bar on the dashboard moves up.
Okay, this I understand. I can just tell it when I get results. I don't need it to connect to my register."

### Observation
*   **Dashboard:** The "Fresh User" state works.
*   **Terminology:** "Anleitungen" is clear.
*   **Check-in:** This was the missing link. He now feels he has a way to "feed" the system his success, even without technical integrations. It turns the dashboard from a static display into a dynamic tracker he controls.

**Status:** ✅ Validated. Integration Gap Bridged.
