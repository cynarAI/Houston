# User Test Results: Freelance Writer Fiona

**Persona:** Fiona (30), Copywriter. Needs Tone of Voice control.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page

" 'AI Marketing Coach'.
I'm skeptical. Will it sound like a robot? 'Delve', 'Unlock', 'Elevate'?
If it uses those words, I'm out."

### 2. Onboarding

"I enter my freelance business.
Goals: 'Write faster', 'Scale to 5 clients'."

### 3. Dashboard & Voice Test

"I go to Chat.
'Write a LinkedIn post about the importance of editing.'
Response: 'In today's fast-paced digital landscape, editing is paramount...'
Ugh. Cringe. 'Paramount'. 'Landscape'.
It sounds like GPT-3.5 default mode.
I look for settings. 'Can I train it on my voice?'
I check 'Strategy'. 'Positioning'... 'Messages'...
There is no 'Voice / Style' setting.
I have to prompt it every time: 'Don't use flowery language. Be punchy.'
That's annoying."

### 4. Conclusion

"It's a useful tool for outlines. But without a 'Custom Instructions' or 'Brand Voice' setting, I spend too much time editing the AI's output to make it sound human. I need to define my style _once_ globally."

## B) Issues & Delights

- **Issue:** Lack of global "Tone of Voice" settings. The default AI tone is too generic/corporate for a creative.
- **Delight:** The structural logic (Chat -> Goals) is nice, but the _quality_ of the text needs voice tuning.

## C) Ratings

- **Understanding:** 10/10
- **Ease:** 9/10
- **Confidence:** 5/10 (Fears generic output).
- **Likelihood:** 6/10 (Only for outlines).
