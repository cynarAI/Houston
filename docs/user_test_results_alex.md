# User Test Results: Agency Owner Alex

**Persona:** Alex (40), Agency Owner. Scaling focus, multiple clients.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page
*Alex is looking for a tool to standardize his agency's output.*
"Pricing... 'Team Plan'. 500 credits.
The question is: Can I have 'Workspaces'? I have 10 clients. I don't want Client A's strategy mixed with Client B's content."
*He looks at the FAQ.*
"Nothing explicit about 'Multiple Workspaces'. It just says 'Houston knows your business'. Singular. That's a worry."

### 2. Onboarding
*He signs up.*
"I'll enter one of my clients: 'Italian Restaurant'.
Goals: 'More lunch reservations'."
*He breezes through.*
"The AI is fast. Summary is accurate."

### 3. Dashboard & Multi-Tenancy Test
*He lands on the Dashboard.*
"Okay, this looks good for the restaurant. Now, how do I add my second client, the 'Law Firm'?"
*He clicks on the profile/workspace switcher (top right usually).*
"I see 'Mein Workspace'. Can I create a new one?
If I create a new workspace, do I need a new subscription? Or does my Team Plan cover multiple workspaces?
This is critical. If I have to pay 10€ per client, it gets expensive fast. If the 40€ plan covers 5 workspaces, it's a steal."
*He explores Settings.*
"I can't find a clear 'Add Workspace' button that explains the billing implication."

### 4. Strategy & Delegation
*He looks at the Strategy section.*
"I can export this as PDF? 'PDF Export = 2 Credits'.
This is great. I can generate the strategy here, export it, and send it to the client as a 'Draft'. That saves me 2 hours of work.
The PDF export is the killer feature for me as an agency. White-labeling would be even better."

### 5. Conclusion
"The product is powerful, but the 'Agency' use case feels half-baked. I need to know how to manage multiple clients cleanly. If I mix them up, it's a disaster. But the content generation and PDF export are strong enough that I might use it just for drafting, even if the workspace management is clunky."

## B) Observed Issues & Delights

### Issues
*   **Workspace Clarity:** The biggest blocker is the unclear handling of multiple projects/clients. Does "Team Plan" mean "My Agency Team" or "Multiple Projects"?
*   **Billing Model:** Unsure if credits are shared across workspaces or per workspace.

### Delights
*   **PDF Export:** He immediately saw the value of selling the AI's output to his clients.
*   **Strategy Structure:** The structured approach (Positioning, Target Audience) aligns perfectly with how agencies work.

## C) Ratings
*   **Understanding:** 8/10 (Product is clear, Workspace model isn't).
*   **Ease of Onboarding:** 10/10
*   **Confidence:** 6/10 (Due to multi-client uncertainty).
*   **Likelihood to Return:** 7/10 (As a drafting tool).
