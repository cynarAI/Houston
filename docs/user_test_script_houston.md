# Standardised User Test Script: Houston

This script is used for all persona simulations to ensure comparability. It covers the end-to-end journey from the public landing page to the first successful interaction in the app.

## 1. Start Point
**Context:** The user sits at their computer (desktop view) and opens the link to `houston.aistronaut.io` (simulated via the local `Landing.tsx`).

## 2. Pre-Task Questions (Mental State)
*Before interacting with the page:*
1.  "Looking at the 'Hero' section (top of page) – what is your immediate impression of what this product is?"
2.  "Who do you think this is for?"
3.  "Would you scroll down or click a button immediately? Why?"

## 3. Core Tasks

### Task 1: Understand the Value Proposition
*Scroll through the landing page.*
*   "In your own words, explain what Houston does."
*   "Find the information about pricing/credits. Do you understand how much it costs?"
*   "Does the 'For Whom' section include you?"

### Task 2: Sign Up & Onboarding
*Click 'Start Free' or similar CTA.*
*   **Scenario:** You are creating a new account.
*   **Onboarding Wizard:**
    *   Fill out the questions about your industry/business.
    *   Review the "Summary" the AI generates.
    *   Review the "SMART Goals" generated.
    *   *Think Aloud:* "Do these goals feel relevant to me? Are they too generic?"

### Task 3: First Dashboard Impression ("Today's Focus")
*Land on the Dashboard.*
*   "What is the first thing you see?"
*   "Do you know what you are supposed to do today?"
*   "How do you feel about the 'Daily Wisdom' or 'Insights' card?"

### Task 4: First Interaction (The "Aha" Moment)
*   **Scenario:** You have a specific problem based on your persona (e.g., Sandra needs a post idea, Lukas needs more customers).
*   **Action:** Navigate to "Chat" or use a "Playbook" (if obvious).
*   "Ask Houston for help with your specific problem."
*   "Read the response. Is it helpful? actionable?"

### Task 5: Check Credits & Plans
*   "Find out how many credits you have left."
*   "Try to understand what 'Deep Analysis' costs vs. a normal chat."
*   "Decide if you would upgrade to a paid plan based on what you've seen so far."
