# User Test Results: Marketing Manager Mia

**Persona:** Mia (32), B2B Marketing Manager. Pro, efficient, critical.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page
*Mia scans the page professionally.*
"Design is clean. Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI... standard modern tech stack look. I like the 'Space' branding, distinct from the usual corporate blue/white."
*She reads 'How it Works'.*
"Plan, Execute, Optimize. Standard loop. I'm interested in the 'Strategy' part. Most AI tools just vomit content. If this actually keeps context of my strategy, that's a win."
*She checks Pricing.*
"Team plan 40€. That's nothing for a B2B budget. '500 Credits'. I need to know what a credit gets me.
Ah, 'Deep Analysis = 3 Credits'. So ~166 analyses. That's plenty."
*She wonders about privacy.*
"Does it train on my data? 'Enterprise Security' badge says no. Good."

### 2. Onboarding
*She enters the wizard.*
"Industry: 'B2B SaaS'. Target: 'CTOs and Devs'. Goal: 'Qualified Leads (MQLs)'."
*She tests the AI's limits.*
"Challenges: 'Long sales cycles, attribution is messy'."
*Step 3: Summary.*
"The summary is solid. It picked up on 'Complex B2B Sales'. Not bad."
*Step 4: SMART Goals.*
"It suggests 'Generate 50 MQLs'. Standard.
'Improve Conversion Rate on Landing Page by 2%'.
Okay, I like that it suggests specific metrics. But I want to connect this to my HubSpot. I assume there are no integrations yet?"
**Action:** She accepts, but makes a mental note to check for API/Integrations.

### 3. Dashboard & Features
*She ignores the 'Today's Focus' for a moment and explores the menu.*
"I go straight to 'Strategy'.
Positioning, Target Audience... okay, it's empty. I have to fill this.
If I fill this, does the Chat know about it? That's the killer feature."
*She goes to Chat.*
"I ask: 'Based on my target audience of CTOs, give me 3 LinkedIn post ideas about technical debt'."
*She analyzes the output.*
"The output is... surprisingly good. It uses the right tone. Not too salesy. It references the 'efficiency' angle I mentioned in onboarding."
*She checks 'Playbooks'.*
"'Content Marketing Playbook'. Let's see the details.
'Steps: Keyword Research, Outline, Draft, Distribute'.
This is great for delegating. I could give this tool to our junior marketing assistant to follow the process."

### 4. Conclusion
"It's a strong productivity tool. It's not a 'Senior Strategist' replacement, but it's a great 'Junior Assistant'. The lack of integrations (HubSpot, GA4) is a blocker for 'real' data tracking, so I'd have to update goals manually. That's annoying. But for content ideation within context? Very good."

## B) Observed Issues & Delights

### Issues
*   **Data Silo:** As a pro, she immediately misses integrations with her existing stack (CRM, Analytics). Updating goals manually feels outdated.
*   **Credit Opacity:** While the landing page explained credits, she wonders how "complex" a chat has to be to count as "Deep Analysis". Is it automatic?

### Delights
*   **Context Awareness:** The fact that the chat remembered her "CTO" audience from onboarding without her repeating it was the biggest win.
*   **Playbooks:** She sees them as "SOPs" (Standard Operating Procedures) she can use to manage her team/interns.

## C) Ratings
*   **Understanding:** 10/10
*   **Ease of Onboarding:** 9/10
*   **Confidence:** 8/10 (Quality is good, integrations missing).
*   **Likelihood to Return:** 8/10 (As a drafting tool).
