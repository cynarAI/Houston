# User Test Synthesis: Houston

**Date:** 03.12.2025
**Personas Tested:** Sandra (Solo Coach), Lukas (Local Business), Mia (Marketing Manager), Daniel (Creator), Alex (Agency).

## 1. Executive Summary
Testing reveals that Houston has a **strong "Aha!" moment** during onboarding (the AI Summary) and high perceived value in its ability to generate specific content (Chats/Playbooks). However, the **Dashboard** can feel overwhelming, and there is a significant gap between the promise of "tracking results" and the reality of no integrations (offline/CRM data). The "Space" aesthetic is unique but risks alienating non-tech users (like Lukas/Sandra) if not balanced with warmer, clearer copy.

## 2. Top 5 Findings (Cross-Persona)

### 1. Onboarding "Magic Moment"
*   **Observation:** Every persona was impressed by Step 3 of onboarding (AI Summary). Seeing their inputs transformed into a professional description built immediate trust.
*   **Impact:** High Positive. This validates the AI's competence before they even enter the app.

### 2. The "Integration Gap"
*   **Observation:** Both the novice (Lukas) and the pro (Mia) stumbled on the SMART goals. Lukas asked "How do you track my offline salon visitors?" and Mia asked "Where is the HubSpot integration?".
*   **Impact:** Critical. The promise of "Marketing that gets done" implies result tracking. Without integrations, the "Progress" section feels like manual data entry (homework).

### 3. Dashboard Overload vs. Guidance
*   **Observation:** The "Today's Focus" card is meant to guide, but the copy was sometimes confusing (telling Sandra to "Tell us about your business" after she just did). Users like Lukas felt the dashboard looked like a "cockpit" (too complex).
*   **Impact:** Medium. Risk of "choice paralysis" on the first visit.

### 4. "Playbooks" = "Missions"
*   **Observation:** The term "Playbook" is clear to Mia/Alex/Daniel, but confusing to Lukas. However, once clicked, the **auto-generation of To-Dos** was universally loved.
*   **Impact:** High Positive. This is the feature that delivers on "saving time".

### 5. Agency/Workspace Confusion
*   **Observation:** Alex (Agency) loves the output but is blocked by unclear "Workspace" management and billing implications for multiple clients.
*   **Impact:** Business Risk. Agencies are high-value customers; confusing them on pricing/structure loses revenue.

## 3. Persona-Specific Insights

*   **Solo Coach Sandra:** Needs warmth. The "Sci-Fi" theme is cool but feels cold. She needs the AI to be an empathetic partner, not a machine.
*   **Local Business Lukas:** Needs a "Zero-Click" solution. He was disappointed he had to copy-paste the text. He wants the AI to post for him.
*   **Creator Daniel:** Mobile first. Found typing inputs tedious. Wants voice input or simpler selectors.
*   **Manager Mia & Alex:** Power users. They see the value in "Drafting" and "PDF Exports" but demand workflow integration.

## 4. Narrative: "The New User Experience"
*Currently, a new user feels...*
"I land on a cool, futuristic page. I understand this will help me with marketing. The onboarding is fun and makes me feel understood. But then I land on a dashboard that looks a bit like a spaceship control panel. I'm told to 'Start a Chat', which gives me great text, but when it comes to 'Goals', I realize I have to update them manually. I feel supported in **ideation**, but still alone in **execution** and **tracking**."

## 5. Recommendations for Improvement Plan
1.  **Fix Dashboard Copy:** Ensure "Today's Focus" acknowledges the onboarding data immediately.
2.  **Clarify "Tracking":** Be honest that goals are currently manual, or add simple "Check-in" features.
3.  **Agency Mode:** creating a clear "Add Client" flow.
4.  **Mobile Polish:** Voice input or better mobile forms for the "Creator" persona.

## Phase 1 Validation (Update)
**Date:** 03.12.2025 (Round 2)

We implemented **critical UX fixes** and re-tested with personas Sandra and Lukas.

### Results:
*   **Dashboard State:** The new "Fresh User" state on the Dashboard ("Ziele sind bereit! 🎯") successfully bridged the gap between Onboarding and Dashboard. Lukas felt "recognized" by the system.
*   **Onboarding Edit:** Enabling goal editing allowed Sandra to switch from "LinkedIn" to "Instagram" easily, increasing her ownership of the plan.
*   **Terminology:** Adding "(Anleitungen)" to "Playbooks" removed the confusion for Lukas.

## Phase 2 Validation (Update)
**Date:** 03.12.2025 (Round 2)

We implemented **Mobile Polish** and **Manual Check-ins**.

### Results:
*   **Mobile Pills (Daniel):** Selecting Industry and Goals via "Pills/Chips" instead of typing drastically improved the mobile onboarding speed.
*   **Check-in Modal (Lukas):** The "Check-in" button allows users to manually update progress. This successfully bridges the "Integration Gap" by giving users control over their metrics without needing complex API setups.

**Status:** Phase 1 & 2 Improvements are **VALIDATED** and live.
