# User Test Results: E-Commerce Emily

**Persona:** Emily (34), Shop Owner. Needs ad variations.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page

_Emily checks the page on her tablet._
"Looks clean. 'Marketing Coach'.
I need ads that convert. Does it do ads?
'Campaigns' is mentioned in the FAQ. Okay."

### 2. Onboarding

"Industry: 'Fashion E-Commerce'.
Goals: 'Lower CPA', 'Higher ROAS'.
SMART Goals: 'Increase Conversion Rate by 0.5%'.
Good goal. Hard to do, but good."

### 3. Dashboard & Ad Creation

"I go to Chat.
'Write 5 Facebook Ad hooks for my sustainable summer dress.'
Response:

1. 'Stop buying fast fashion. Start wearing quality.'
2. 'The only dress you need this summer.'
   ...
   These are okay. A bit generic.
   I ask: 'Make them more controversial.'
   Response:
3. 'Why your wardrobe is destroying the planet.'
4. 'Fast fashion is ugly. Here is why.'
   Okay, better!
   Now, how do I save these?
   I have to copy them to a spreadsheet? I want to save them as 'Ad Set 1' in the app."

### 4. Conclusion

"The brainstorming is fast. But I need a place to store my 'Winning Angles'. The 'Strategy' section is too high-level. I need a 'Library' of hooks and angles."

## B) Issues & Delights

- **Issue:** No place to save/organize specific _content assets_ (like Ad Hooks) other than the chat history.

## C) Ratings

- **Ease:** 9/10
