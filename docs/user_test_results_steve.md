# User Test Results: Startup Founder Steve

**Persona:** Steve (26), Tech Founder. Tech-savvy, needs narrative help.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page

_Steve lands on the page._
"Cool background. React/Three.js? Nice.
'Marketing that gets done'. Okay. I don't need 'marketing' per se, I need traction and investors.
I check the pricing. Free tier. Good. I have 0 burn rate."

### 2. Onboarding

"Industry: 'B2B SaaS'. Product: 'AI-powered code documentation'.
Goals: 'Seed Round Funding', 'First 100 Beta Users'.
Summary: 'SaaS für Entwickler, Fokus auf Early Adopters und Investoren'.
It got the 'Investors' part. Nice.
SMART Goals: 'Contact 50 VCs'. 'Get 100 Beta Signups'.
Okay, standard goals. I accept."

### 3. Dashboard & First Interaction

_Steve goes to the Dashboard._
"I see 'Playbooks'. I click it.
'Launch Campaign', 'Content Marketing'.
Where is 'Pitch Deck'? Or 'Investor Story'?
I try the Chat.
'Help me write a pitch deck slide about the problem of code documentation.'
Response: 'Sure! Here is a structure: 1. The Pain (Docs are always outdated)...'.
This is actually good content. But I have to copy-paste it into Keynote.
I wish there was a 'Strategy' section specifically for my 'Company Narrative'."

### 4. Strategy Section

_He clicks Strategy._
"Positioning, Target Audience... this is marketing lingo.
I need 'Problem/Solution', 'Market Size', 'Secret Sauce'.
The structure is a bit rigid for a startup pitch."

### 5. Conclusion

"It's a great copywriting tool for my slides. But the 'Strategy' section feels like it's designed for a generic SMB, not a high-growth startup. I need to define my _Narrative_, not just my _Channels_."

## B) Issues & Delights

- **Issue:** The "Strategy" fields (Positioning/Channels) don't map 1:1 to a Startup Pitch Deck structure (Problem/Solution/Market).
- **Delight:** The Chat's understanding of technical topics (Code Docs) was surprisingly accurate.

## C) Ratings

- **Understanding:** 9/10
- **Ease:** 10/10
- **Confidence:** 7/10 (Needs better narrative tools).
- **Likelihood:** 8/10 (For slide copy).
