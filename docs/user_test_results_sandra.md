# User Test Results: Solo Coach Sandra

**Persona:** Sandra (38), Life Coach. Tech-hesitant, wants guidance, afraid of overwhelm.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page
*Sandra lands on the homepage.*
"Okay, 'AI Marketing Coach'... 'Marketing that gets done'. That sounds good. I always procrastinate my marketing."
*She looks at the space background.*
"It looks a bit... sci-fi? 'Houston by AIstronaut'. Okay, cute theme. I hope it's not too techy for me."
*She scrolls to 'How it Works'.*
"Step 1: Share Goal. Step 2: Get Plan. That sounds simple enough. I like that it says 'Less thinking, more doing' in the benefits. That is EXACTLY my problem."
*She checks the 'For Whom' section.*
"Ah, 'Solo Coach & Consultant'. That's me! 'You have many ideas but no time for planning.' Yes, captured perfectly."
*She sees the Pricing.*
"Free starter credits. No credit card. Okay, low risk. I'll try it."
**Action:** Clicks "Start Free".

### 2. Onboarding
*Enters the Onboarding Wizard.*
"Oh, 'Hey! Ich bin Houston'. The waving hand emoji is friendly. It feels personal."
*Step 2: Questions.*
"Industry... 'Life Coaching'. Company size... '1-5'. Target Audience... 'Mothers returning to work'. This is easy."
"Challenges... 'I hate selling myself'. Goals... 'Get 3 new clients this month'."
*She clicks Next and waits.*
"It says 'Generiere Zusammenfassung...'. Okay, let's see if it understood me."
*Step 3: Summary.*
"Wow. It summarized my gibberish into a professional paragraph. 'Fokus auf Personal Branding für Mütter'. That sounds much better than what I wrote."
*Step 4: SMART Goals.*
"What is SMART? Ah, there is a small explanation box. Specific, Measurable... okay.
It suggests: 'Win 3 new coaching clients via LinkedIn outreach by end of month'.
Hmm, LinkedIn? I usually use Instagram. Can I change this? I don't see an edit button easily. I guess I'll just accept it for now."
**Action:** Clicks "Ziele annehmen".

### 3. Dashboard & First Interaction
*Confetti animation plays.*
"Oh, nice! That felt rewarding."
*She lands on the Dashboard.*
"Okay, dark mode. It looks very... professional. Maybe a bit dark for a life coach site, but sleek."
*She sees the 'Today's Focus' Hero card.*
" 'Guten Tag, Sandra. Lass uns loslegen!'. It tells me exactly what to do: 'Erzähl Houston von deinem Business'. But I just did that in onboarding? A bit confusing. Ah, wait, the button says 'Erstes Gespräch starten'."
*She notices the 'Daily Wisdom' card.*
" 'Pareto-Prinzip'. Interesting. It feels like a little fortune cookie."
*She looks at the 'Credits' banner.*
"50 Credits. Okay. I hope I don't use them up too fast."

**Action:** She clicks "Erstes Gespräch starten".
"I'll ask him: 'How do I start on Instagram without feeling annoying?'"
*Chat interface opens (simulated).*
"He replies instantly. He gives me a 3-step plan: 1. Story about my own struggle, 2. Client testimonial, 3. Soft pitch.
This is actually helpful. It's not just 'post more', it's specific."

### 4. Conclusion
"I like it. It feels like having a smart buddy. I'm a bit worried about the 'Strategy' and 'Playbooks' buttons in the menu, that looks complicated. But if I just stick to the chat and the daily tasks, I can do this."

## B) Observed Issues & Delights

### Issues
*   **Confusion:** The "Today's Focus" prompted her to "Tell Houston about your business" even though she just completed onboarding. She expected it to say "Here is your first task".
*   **Friction:** In the SMART goals step of onboarding, she couldn't easily edit the channel (LinkedIn vs Instagram) suggested by the AI without feeling like she was breaking the flow.
*   **Visuals:** The dark "sci-fi" theme is cool but might feel a bit too "masculine/techy" for a warm, empathetic life coach brand.

### Delights
*   **Copy:** The "Solo Coach" persona section on the landing page made her feel seen instantly.
*   **Onboarding:** The summary step gave her confidence that the AI "understood" her before she even started.
*   **Simplicity:** The "Today's Focus" card (despite the text mismatch) is great because it hides the complexity of the rest of the app.

## C) Ratings
*   **Understanding:** 9/10
*   **Ease of Onboarding:** 8/10
*   **Confidence:** 8/10
*   **Likelihood to Return:** 9/10 (She needs the daily nudge).

## Round 2 Validation (Phase 1 Fixes)

**Date:** 03.12.2025
**Focus:** Onboarding Goal Editing

### Scenario Re-run
*Sandra reaches Step 4: SMART Goals.*
"Okay, it suggests 'LinkedIn outreach' again. But now I see a little pencil icon next to the goal. Oh, nice."
**Action:** She clicks the pencil icon.
"The fields open up. 'Win 3 new coaching clients via...'. I just delete 'LinkedIn' and type 'Instagram'. I also change 'outreach' to 'stories'. Click Save."
"Now it says: 'Win 3 new coaching clients via Instagram stories'. Perfect. That feels much more like MY plan now."

### Observation
The friction is gone. She didn't have to accept a strategy she didn't believe in. She took ownership of the goal immediately. This small change significantly increased her buy-in.

**Status:** ✅ Validated. Issue Resolved.
