# User Test Results: Digital Creator Daniel

**Persona:** Daniel (29), Creator. Aesthetics-focused, wants conversion, mobile-heavy user.

## A) Think-Aloud Narrative

### 1. Landing Page (Mobile View Simulation)
*Daniel opens the site on his iPhone.*
"Nice gradient. 'Marketing that gets done'. The text is a bit large on mobile, the 'AI Marketing Coach' badge is misaligned? No, looks okay."
*He scrolls.*
"The glass-morphism cards are cool. Very 'Apple' style.
'Solo Plan - 100 Credits'. Okay. I spend more on coffee."
*He checks the screenshots.*
"The dashboard looks a bit crowded on the small screen screenshot. Let's see the real thing."

### 2. Onboarding
"The wizard is smooth. Progress bar is nice.
Input fields... I hate typing on mobile. I wish I could voice dictate."
*He types 'Fitness Course' and 'Dads' broadly.*
*Step 3: Summary.*
"It says 'Fitness-Coaching für Väter'. Accurate."
*Step 4: Goals.*
"Goal: 'Sell 10 course licenses'. Simple. I like it."
"Animation with the confetti—dope. I like those micro-interactions. Makes it feel premium."

### 3. Dashboard
*He lands on Dashboard.*
"Whoa. On mobile, the 'Today's Focus' card takes up the whole screen.
'Guten Tag, Daniel'.
The 'Daily Wisdom' is hidden below the fold.
I click 'Playbooks' in the hamburger menu."
*He looks at Playbooks.*
"'Social Media Growth'. 'Launch Campaign'.
Launch Campaign is what I need. I click it.
'Mission Starten'.
It created todos for me? 'Define offer', 'Write email sequence'.
Okay, this saves me from setting up a Notion template. This is actually useful."

### 4. Feature Test: Credits & Upgrading
"I want to see what happens if I click 'Deep Dive Analyse' on the dashboard.
'3 Credits'. Click.
It loads... 'Your retention could be better...'.
Okay, nice info. But where do I see my credit history? I tap on the '50 Credits' badge.
It takes me to a pricing page? Or settings? It's not super clear where to *manage* my subscription."

### 5. Conclusion
"The UI is definitely better than most AI wrappers. It feels like a real app.
I'd use this to structure my launches. The 'Mission' feature is the best part—turning a vague idea like 'Launch' into a checklist instantly."

## B) Observed Issues & Delights

### Issues
*   **Mobile Input:** Typing business details on mobile was tedious. Voice input would be a killer feature for creators on the go.
*   **Navigation:** Finding where to manage/upgrade the plan from the dashboard wasn't immediately obvious (clicked the badge, expected a profile/billing page).

### Delights
*   **Aesthetics:** He loved the "Glassmorphism" and "Space" theme. It fits his vibe.
*   **Missions:** The instant creation of a Todo-list from a Playbook was the high point. It felt like "installing a workflow".

## C) Ratings
*   **Understanding:** 9/10
*   **Ease of Onboarding:** 8/10 (Mobile typing friction).
*   **Confidence:** 9/10
*   **Likelihood to Return:** 9/10 (For launch planning).
