        "question": "How does the credit system work?",

        "question": "Is my data secure with Houston?",
        "answer": "Yes! We take security seriously. Houston uses enterprise-grade encryption for all data transmission and storage.

        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You can cancel your credit pack subscription (Orbit or Galaxy) at any time with no questions asked. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your billing period, and you can export all your data. No hidden fees or cancellation charges. Unused credits from one-time purchases (Mission Boosters) never expire."

      "strategies": {
        "question": "What kind of marketing strategies can Houston help with?",
        "answer": "Houston supports all major marketing strategies including content marketing, social media campaigns, email marketing, SEO optimization, paid advertising, and brand positioning.

      },
      "technical": {
        "question": "Do I need technical knowledge to use Houston?",

      },
      "creditUsage": {

You'll always see how many credits an action costs before you proceed. You'll be notified when your balance is low (<20 credits)."
